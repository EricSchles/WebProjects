   <h1>On the way of life</h1>
    <p>Living for the approval of others is not living at all.</p>
   <h2>Everyone has someone they look up to.  A master if you will.</h2>
    <p>This person comes in many shapes and sizes and is specific to you.</p>
   <h3>You cannot let them conquer you though.  You must see them as a collaborator in your life.</h3>
    <p>Only live for your own approval.  It's the only thing that matters.</p>
   <h4>No one is perfect, not even those you look up to.  We all make mistakes.</h4>
    <p>The sooner you can accept that, the sooner you can accept responsibility for yourself.</p>
   <h5>Sometimes you have to let it all go.</h5>
    <p>Just live your life.</p>
   <h6>Living with honor is never easy.</h6>
    <p>It's something you choose to do.  It's never something you earn.</p>
