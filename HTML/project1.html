    <h1>Welcome to my website.</h1>
     <p>It is static for now.  However not for long.</p>
     <p>Eventually I'll learn javascript and php and then my webpages will be dynamic.</p>
     <p>Adapting to my users needs and wants with the simple click of a mouse or pad.</p>
     <p>I will buttonize everything, it will be gloious.</p>
    <h2>So I guess I'll explain a little bit of how static pages work.</h2>
     <p>Probably for the best to start with what html really is.</p>
     <p>So let's do some research.</p>
     <p>All of my analysis comes from here:</p>
     <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/">html5rocks</a>
     <p>It's a pretty good article definitely worth your time.</p>
     <p>I give it a <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Symbol_thumbs_up.svg" height=50 width=50 /></p>
     <p>And you should too!</p>
     <h3>The internals will be explained soon.  I really just wanted to get this project started now.</h3>
     <p>Like any good project, it will take real time and effort to finish this.</p>
